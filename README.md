# WDI Project 1 - Domineering

## Introduction: The Game

Domineering is a mathematical game introduced by Goran Andersson in 1974 and played on chequered boards of different sizes. It involves placing dominoes that cover two squares: one player places the dominoes in a horizontal orientation, while the other player places them in a vertical orientation. The first player who is unable to place a domino on the board has lost the game.
